pattern,INSTR,QLTY
 sigh in order to not be completely dismissive i guess i can see where you re coming from in that they are both higher pitched string instruments capable of vibrato and have a certain QLTY quality but no not at all and sustain doesn t really have anything to do with timbre QLTY INSTR on the other hand though i would say the timbre is more similar to that of a INSTR,"['guitar', 'cello']","['nasal', 'bowed']"

 i would by all means avoid variaudio for at least two reasons it really only works on monophonic parts one note at a time no chords or harmonies and when it analyzes the track to find harmonic content it always misses the little details in between the notes string fret noise transients or ends of notes breaths for vocals etc while these may seem nice to keep intact it really only creates weird jumps glitches in your sound instead opt for the built in QLTY processing i almost always use the algorithm poly complex formant if i want a transparent QLTY you could also try just poly complex which won t preserve your formant but may sound good imho the other algos are really only useful for saving some loading time they re faster or creating lo-fi sounds but your mileage may certainly vary try the musical algos and if it s a monophonic sound you could go for the solo algos but i find treating each sound as poly and complex will work better as all real sounds have polyphonic overtones and are pretty complex,[],"['pitch shift', 'pitch shift']"

 when 23f0 a song d83c dfb6 d83c dfb5 d83c dfa4 is converted 21aa into midi d83c dd92 you d83d dc49 can still d83e dd1e d83d de4c hear d83d dc42 vocals d83d dde3 because of timbre if you re playing d83c dfae INSTR d83e dd20 d83c dfb8 when 23f0 you d83d dc48 pluck d83e dd0f one 261d d83d de4f d83c dffc of the strings d83c dfa3 it makes d83d dd95 a bunch d83c df7c of frequencies d83d dce1 the loudest is called d83d dcf2 the fundamental d83d dc91 which is the note d83d dcdd d83d dd75 d83d dd2d we hear d83d dc42 the others d83d dc6a are called d83d dcde overtones and while we don t d83d deab hear d83d dd0a d83d de49 them the overtones are what make d83d dd95 a INSTR d83d de02 sound d83d dc42 different d83d de21 from a INSTR d83c dfb9 for example d83d dcaa the overtones are what we call d83d dcde 260e an instrument s d83c dfb8 timbre since d83d dc68 a midi d83c dd92 is like d83d de04 d83e dd8a sheet d83d dc49 music d83c dfbc d83c dfb5 d83c dfb8 being read d83d dcd6 by a computer d83d dcbb when d83c df51 you d83d dc48 convert d83d debf d83e ddf9 d83c df2a an mp3 to midi d83c dd92 it doesn t just write d83d dcdd the fundamental d83d dc69 d83c dffd 200d 2696 fe0f 2728 pitch d83d de24 pt d83d de33 d83d dc45 counts d83d dd22 any slight d83d dc4c changes d83d debc in pitch d83c dfa4 and volume d83d dc69 200d d83d dc69 200d d83d dc66 as new d83d dc4c notes d83d dcdd and also d83d dc68 writes 270d down 2b07 the overtones the human d83d dc64 voice d83d de03 d83d dd0a d83d dce2 also d83d dc68 has overtones so despite d83d deab the sound d83c df0b d83d dca5 d83d dd0a being a INSTR d83c dfb9 the default d83d de4a instrument d83c dfbb d83c dfba for most midi d83c dd92 dlses the midi d83c dd92 is still d83e dd1e d83d de4c playing d83c dfbd the overtones so you d83d dc49 can still d83e dd1e d83d de4c hear d83d dc42 the voices d83d dd0a also d83d dc68 mp3 is an audio file d83d dcc2 so the reason d83c df1f every d83d dcaf sound d83d dd0a is a INSTR d83c dfb9 is because it was as if every 261d d83c dffc sound d83d dc42 INSTR d83e dd41 and all d83d dcaf were being played d83c dfb2 in the same channel d83d dcfa d83d dce1 and since d83d dc68 INSTR d83e dd41 technically d83e dd4b d83e dd39 have pitch d83c dfa4 as well d83d de26 d83d dc40 d83e dd37 as overtones that s d83d de26 why d83e dd14 d83e dd37 you d83d dc48 hear d83d dc42 that low d83d dd09 QLTY d83d de31 sound d83d dd0a in a converted 21aa INSTR d83e dd41 midi d83c dd92 note d83d dcd3 d83d dcda d83d dcd2 midi d83c dd92 technically d83d dd27 274c isn t an audio file d83d de0d as nothing 274c 274e has been recorded d83d dcf7 d83d dcf8 d83c dfa5 it s more like d83d dc4d sheet d83d decf music d83d dd0a d83c dfb5 d83c dfb6 in that it s a set d83d dcd0 of instructions 26a0 being read d83d dcd6 to a computer d83d dcbb i e d83c df6d d83c dd71 play d83c dfbd this sound d83d dc42 at this pitch d83d deab d83d de46 d83c dffb at this time 23f0,"['guitar', 'violin', 'piano', 'piano', 'piano', 'drums', 'drums', 'drum']",['horror']
 when music is converted to midi you can listen to songs for a ton if you want to remove one of the strings and play the INSTR create a lot of frequencies the biggest voice is that we actually hear the recording others call it dubbing and we don t hear it but dubbing makes a different INSTR sound than a INSTR dubbing is a tool we call tim bray midi is like a music table read from a computer so the main field is not written when you convert mp3 to midi pt calculates small changes in process and volume such as new notes and other recordings human voices also have a rear sound so even listening like a INSTR the main instrument in most midi dlses midi still plays bass so you can hear the sound in addition mp3 is an audio file so it seems that all sounds are played on the same channel so all sounds are INSTR INSTR technically have the same tone so you hear a low QLTY in the midi INSTR converter note technically midi is not an audio file because it has no record it s like music read on your computer as play this sound in the field at the moment,"['guitar', 'violin', 'piano', 'piano', 'piano', 'drums', 'drum']",['horror']
 i was gonna say buy a musicman but if i m gonna try to not be a dick when you boost a frequency in your bass also cut it in anything that may take up that same range edit thats some QLTY QLTY,[],"['nice round', 'juicy bass']"
 if you re having these types of problems put your compressor before your eq in the signal chain then on your eq 700-800 is the magic range for that snappiness in the bass an alternative and more dramatic technique is to create a send for your bass channel to an auxiliary channel pre-fader and do the following 1 compress the crap out of it -35db threshold 10 1 ratio nastiness 2 run an amp simulator on it sansamp works fine add some gain drive QLTY turn down the bass and turn up the mids and highs this shoudl give you a QLTY QLTY QLTY sound 3 bring this down and gently bring it up into the mix you re not really wanting to hear this much audibly but adding this textured double will help the bass cut through the mix a bit,[],"['distortion', 'higher', 'grungy', 'distorted bass']"
 dream pop originally almost exclusively referred to the acts that we now refer to as shoegaze along with ar kane who coined the former term and influenced some of the acts in question with the two now being considered something somewhat separate i suppose there s still a dreaminess to dream pop still but it s quite a bit broader than it was before seemingly covering any artist or genre that uses a QLTY and QLTY and now covers a lot of acts that weren t associated with the term at the time modern dream pop sounds more like indie soft rock than anything especially derived from post punk for as much of it is compared to cocteau twins i get more of a poorman s fleetwood mac vibe from most of the modern acts,[],"['chorus effect', 'reverb']"
 avey and deak are big fans of QLTY QLTY QLTY and modulation effects phase flange and auto-wah take into account double-tracking overdubbing and other studio magic that went into making the sounds i would also experiment on how you route the effects too like modulation into QLTY i bet you can get some wild sounds from that i can take educated guesses what effects are used on each song peacebone - pitch-shifter and maybe QLTY unsolved mysteries - pitch-shifter and tremolo the main INSTR is a sample being pitch shifted chores - i don 2019t think there is actually a INSTR being played on this track until the outro my guess is that the rhythm guitar is a sample being played chromatically which is why it sounds so other-worldly that sampled INSTR is probably just a INSTR with the QLTY effect that is heavily used on feels for the outro INSTR the sporadic boings i 2019m guessing it 2019s a QLTY and phaser for reverend green - rhythm INSTR pitch-shifter QLTY hence the QLTY and QLTY lead pitch-shifter QLTY and maybe phase flange and it 2019s all double-tracked fireworks - there 2019s that feels QLTY again but with some added QLTY i think there 2019s some phase going on too 1 - pitch-shifter and QLTY maybe a volume pedal too because it kinda has a swell to it winter wonder land - pitch-shifter cuckoo - pitch-shifter and QLTY with a touch of QLTY derek - pitch-shifter QLTY phase there 2019s a INSTR sounding synth playing a harmony with the INSTR too so it might sound exactly right without that i hope this helps i know this is not in great detail so if there are any questions on how to dial in the sounds i can hopefully help with that too,"['guitar', 'guitar', 'guitar', 'guitar', 'guitar', 'guitar', 'pan-flute', 'guitar']","['slap back delay', 'tremolo', 'pitch-shifting', 'pitch-shifting', 'light distortion', 'slap-back', 'delay', 'tremolo', 'choppiness', 'distortion', 'delay', 'slap-back', 'tremolo', 'tremolo', 'tremolo', 'slap-back', 'delay']"

 i would suggest you look at getting a dedicated acoustic INSTR amp you re probably going to need to spend a few hundred bucks at least even then your rig so far is fairly unique so the only way to be sure is to take it all down to a INSTR shop pedals and all and try it through whatever acoustic amps they have and see what you like the only thing that you won t get with an acoustic amp is QLTY as it s specifically designed to not distort if you want a QLTY you ll need to buy another pedal for that if you just want cheap and cheerful behringer do a fairly decent sounding range of pedals for around 50 each let us know how you get on,"['guitar', 'guitar']","['distortion', 'grungey distortion']"
 it really just depends on your amp tomas doesn t use many effect pedals i m pretty sure he goes straight through to his mesa boogie amp s QLTY so just use your built in QLTY and if that isn t enough look at some QLTY pedals the boss d-1 pedal is a good one to look at i had an ibanez tonelok sm7 smash box and absolutely loved it until i lost it in a flooded basement,[],"['distortion', 'distortion', 'distortion']"
 timbre is an under-theorized aspect of music the best we seem to be able to do is words indicating expression QLTY QLTY QLTY etc or technique QLTY QLTY INSTR will also indicate string and position choice where the tonal effect of that choice rather than open strings is important nothing afaik more specific than that of course the more experienced we get as players the more we understand about how to choose appropriate timbres personally i don t crave any more precise instructions in notation than we already have but i agree some more precise or conventionally agreed terminology for different timbral sounds would be handy i can t offer any myself though,['classical guitar'],"['dolce', 'cantando', 'metallic', 'pont', 'tasto']"
 this is a point i cannot stress enough move your basses to audio and preset don 2019t do sound design in the same session that you then plan on writing your songs in i know this is something we hear often but don 2019t underestimate it doing so allows for much easier manipulation of bass into new sounds through chopping cutting and rearranging and allows you to focus almost entirely on arrangement and mixing which can lead to a much more coherent drop the cost with samples is that you can get artifacts when QLTY - often these lead to cool and unintended sounds or even this limitation results in you finding funky ways around it that you wouldn 2019t do otherwise i 2019ve slept on this advice for at least 1 5 years and started doing it about 2 months ago and my productivity on songs has gone up so much and being able to focus purely on writing the drop instead of sound design at the same time seems to result in drops that just work better for me to add to that if it 2019s a more harmonic bass instead of general glitch mess sine compression etc you can keep it as a preset to follow the key of the chord progression in your drop to avoid having to work around QLTY artifacts the answer is pretty much yes but it 2019s also important to remember that these people are incredibly good at what they do,[],"['pitch shifting', 'pitch shifting']"
 a couple things that should be mentioned to add on avoid anything that says audiophile on it you re just paying a premium for no reason are they good products probably but your money will go farther looking for entry level pro-audio products the ubiquity of home recording enthusiasts means that high quality sound reproduction has become pretty affordable op mentioned this but avoid gaming as well you re paying for style on shitty plastic components sweetwater musician s friend and even INSTR center will have everything you need to get a great setup a good digital audio converter dac also known as an audio interface should not be overlooked this is the piece of hardware that converts 1s and 0s into variable voltage that speakers and headphones use to generate sound they will allow for QLTY QLTY audio with QLTY than your motherboard s built-in dac as a bonus they usually have a built in high quality headphone amp speaker volume control and mic inputs that can be used for in-game chat or discord or record your own music if you re so inclined a few brand recommendations focusrite audio interfaces apogee audio interfaces and usb mics blue microphones of the usb and analog varieties audio technica headphones analog mics sennheiser headphones also makes mics but they re expensive source i m a professional audio engineer,['guitar'],"['cleaner', 'less noisy', 'less distortion']"

 you can t hear the INSTR through the mass of effects on show there so no i don t the INSTR sounds like a INSTR until you start lumping on the effects then you can make it sound however you like which is a whole world of QLTY and why the INSTR is so popular you can even make it sound like a INSTR if you want,"['guitar', 'electric guitar', 'guitar', 'electirc guitar', 'violin']",['noise']

 tie the cutoff of the filter the strength of the envelope any number of other parameters to the velocity of the keystroke you can make it so that the harder the note is struck the more the filter opens the QLTY the sound is there s a slight upward pitch bend or whatever other features you want to use to get the real feel synthesis is awesome,[],['brighter']
 nice write up your conclusion regarding the amp doesn 2019t surprise me much i find that the headphones generally tend to make a far more substantial difference in sound than the amp and dac do at least to a certain degree i 2019ve never heard the jds stack you have but from what i 2019ve read it seems highly competent and will serve both of those headphones well i am someone who found the clear to have a slightly QLTY or QLTY sound to it in the treble region i 2019m not sure why but that 2019s just how i remember them sounding to my ear i 2019d love to try them again some day to see if i still feel that way i had similar concluding thoughts as you did when i owned a pair of clears and hd 660s clears were definitely better but the 660s were crazy good and very competitive for a bit less than half the price however this combined with essentially everything you said regarding repairability drove me to sell the clears and find something a bit different to compliment the 660s i agree completely with your overall conclusion - the hd 600 series headphones are incredibly solid and hold their ground even against much more expensive headphones,[],"['metallic', 'dry']"

 just my opinion here but i hated the hyperx cloud 2 it was always QLTY and QLTY not very comfortable with but too much clamping force and it was short for my head it gets hot after a while too also it didn 2019t have the best directional cues i sold them and got the sennheiser pc37x i was blown away much more natural sounding doesn 2019t get hot definitely much more comfortable but not the most comfortable they don 2019t have a 201cfun 201d sound but i prefer the natural sound they have others might disagree and it sounds amazing for music amazing,[],"['too loud', 'bassy']"
 i love my ath-m50x s personally it s a huge leap to those from shitty razer headsets though i mostly use my pc to listen to music and make music though so it s a must to have high quality audio one thing i would note is the ath-m50x s aren t necessarily more bass heavy but have a v shape bias as in the highs and lows will be exaggerated i use them to mix music and i always have to use multiple pairs of headphones and speakers to make sure it sounds good i am guessing for the audience this is meant for though heavy bass is not by any means QLTY or overpowered on them and much lighter than headphones advertised as bass boost headphones the ath-mxxx line is made for studio use not necessarily gaming so they naturally will be made to be flatter than normal headphones for gaming or listening i will say they are 100x better though i have went through a pair of m20x m40x and m50x and the 50x is my choice personally i will say the m20x i would recommend buying new earfoam for it after being on your head all day it will start to hurt one last thing to note don t buy a dac if you don t need it you might need it for a 500 pair of open-back sennheisers but i guarantee you won t need one for most headphones under 300 check first but my ath-m50x s are powered fine by my motherboards sound card an amp doesn t improve the quality it just draws power if the soundcard can t draw enough,[],['muddy']

 the timbre of the open high e string is much different from the timbre of the same note played at the 14th fret on the d string since a INSTR is never really in tune with itself playing the same note on two separate strings will create a sort of QLTY sound due to slight differences in tuning,['guitar'],['chorused']
 it can be pretty useful on QLTY INSTR to give it a different timbre and accent a certain note within a chord for instance c m with an open high e string in addition to the fretted e on the b string sounds a little bit different than without the open e it s especially useful as a droning tone while playing a melody on another string as you can have an illusion of going between 1 note and 2 notes but the sound stays full and timbre stays mostly the same for a good example of this you can listen to the INSTR at the beginning of my hero by the foo fighters it also can just make things sound more QLTY to play fretted and open strings with the same pitch you get a stronger transient from picking multiple strings and combine the resonance of both strings plus it s easier to strum more aggressively if you aren t worried as much about only strumming one string this also requires good muting technique to make sure you don t have all the other strings sounding a good example of this is the prechorus of on my own by saosin - all of these factors are much more about timbre than actual harmony though so for genres where timbre is typically less significant classical folk etc i would say it isn t really that significant however in terms of harmony it does enable a lot of droning notes for pedal point progressions or interesting spread voicings of chords,"['guitar', 'guitar']","['distorted', 'aggressive']"

 accessory house makes some great sheepskin pads for these agreed otherwise it s a great headphone even if it can be a tad sharp the bass kicks like nothing else e-mu teaks are also very good but they boost the mids considerably at the expense of some of the bass speed decay and have QLTY treble,[],['less sharp']
 as a guitarist who often plays jazz i agree with you there is a lot of possibilities within the world of QLTY INSTR tones the examples you gave are perfect i think metheny s tone is a little more QLTY and QLTY more treble or mids i suppose adam rogers has got more of the QLTY QLTY QLTY thing going on depending on the context i like that QLTY tone but i think some players let it get a tad too QLTY for my tastes anywho the INSTR by its very nature offers vast timbral possibilities that could be massively useful in that context i imagine it is just a matter of time before we see more of it hopefully the los angeles 8 are a INSTR ensemble that plays INSTR here is a video of them playing the third movement of steve reich s electric counterpoint i get the impression that they are trying to earn the INSTR some street cred in the realm of concert music the ensemble is different than the context you suggested but it seemed relevant,"['electric guitar', 'electric guitar', 'guitar', 'electric guitars', 'electric guitar']","['clean', 'bright', 'clear', 'dark', 'warm', 'bassy', 'warm', 'muddy']"
 one sneaky trick you have for an QLTY INSTR timbre,['guitar'],['impressive bass']
 emo - initially started as emotional hardcore with bands like rites of spring then there was the second wave that had a more QLTY style with bands like american football and mineral then there was the third wave where it had its commercial breakthrough and these days when your average person hears the word emo they think of my chemical romance fall out boy and paramore - basically pop rock bands with swoopy haircuts and hot topic fashion,[],['mellow']
 math rock from what i understand it used to refer to music with QLTY INSTR and a raw sound that incorporated complex drumming and rhythms like polvo now everybody seems to use it as a synonym for american football knockoffs - that twinkly clean-as-can-be INSTR sound that happens to be in weird time signatures,"['guitars', 'guitar']",['heavily distorted']
 post rock used to be a lot broader described bands with quite different sounds like slint tortoise or talk talk feels like now it is more narrow bands tend to sound like eits clones with that QLTY INSTR sound and big crescendos,['guitar'],['chiming']
 is learning to sing more like learning to swim losing weight than learning the INSTR INSTR does it take years to develop the vocal cord for wider vocal range QLTY QLTY tone and timbre,"['piano', 'guitar']","['fuller', 'richer']"
 we do have many terms that spectrally mean something but because of an average lack of understanding about complex spectral analysis were left with words like QLTY QLTY QLTY QLTY QLTY QLTY QLTY etc some timbre words often overlap with dynamic specifications like QLTY for example that could possibly mean quiet but also imply a method of playing or timbre these i believe are the problem areas that should better be explained really the problem is language and culture as the culture of historical language in music has evolved to imply more meaning than the words themselves likely the evolution of language in music will continue to progress towards specific terminology as composers usage of the terms become more detailed and less traditional however it 2019s also likely that it will continue to stay the same for the sake of preserving historical context it 2019s definitely an interesting topic and proves that the language within music is its own culture and is constantly evolving what you are explaining however is not a word for timbre it is a word for technique,[],"['metallic', 'dull', 'dark', 'percussive', 'bright', 'sharp', 'soft', 'soft']"
 i had the same issue question for a while lol i think what helped me is realizing that the random elements make up the chord a lot of the times like the sub might be a g and the lead sound might be a d and the weird QLTY sounds might be a b or alternate between them and all together you have a g chord even if it doesn 2019t necessarily sound like it hope that makes sense,[],['glitchy']
 idk is a rock chorus really just a INSTR a INSTR and pieced together lead INSTR vocals a drop is a high energy section of the music if it sounds QLTY it is because you have too many loud things going on in the same frequency range usually the low mids in a rock track assuming your INSTR and vocals are in the same octave you can either have a QLTY and QLTY lead INSTR QLTY and QLTY vocals or QLTY and QLTY both or you can just take the vocals out of the same octave as the INSTR and suddenly things start sounding QLTY again your brain doesn t like to try and decode a bunch of shit hanging out near each other in a pitch sense it s just too much work and so individual elements lose clarity this applies especially to bass sounds that engage in lots of destructive interference with each other and eat up your headroom without sounding very loud ever wonder why nobody has two bass INSTR players it s not only because they are all lazy shits that don t know how to play the same thing applies to electronic music sometimes the kick is the sub bass if it isn t then there is room for a real sub bass sometimes the midrange bass has a sub bass of it s own sometimes they are separate in all cases you never have two sub basses unless you are using the phasing to create a volume oscillation pre QLTY a reese bass tl dr just make something that sounds cool and if it is QLTY then remove competing frequencies first in the composition then in mixing and eq,"['bass guitar', 'drum set', 'guitar', 'guitar', 'guitar', 'guitar', 'guitar']","['muddy', 'loud', 'clear', 'loud', 'clear', 'muddy', 'loud', 'clear', 'distortion', 'muddy']"
 in modern dubstep like the producers you ve mentioned 100 yes sub drone kick snare maybe a hat and a perc and a fuck ton of weird QLTY midrange it s been virtually unchanged for over a decade other than perhaps it s gotten less rhythmic over the years dubstep is typically one of the least musical subgenres and certainly the least rhythmic its allure rests entirely on its hyper-aggressive sound design before someone gets mad at me listen to early benga and skream and tell me the genre hasn t gotten less musical and rhythmic and become entirely focused on sound design,[],['distorted']
 now we re talking about resonance and what amplifies the vibrations from the strings and out to the air both size of the resonance chamber or lack thereof and the materials used to make it comes into play with distinguishing sounds most wooden string instruments are hollow allowing the sound to bounce back and forth inside the body of the instrument and the amount of bouncing the sound does influences the sound a INSTR is much bigger than a INSTR so the sound bounces a lot making a QLTY QLTY tune,"['piano', 'guitar']","['rounder', 'softer']"
 my strings sometimes sound different when playing the same not on different strings this is normal and probably not a result of the string type part of it is because the strings are different thicknesses part of it is the timbre of the string is different because of the length of the vibrating section of the string typically the frets 5-7 or so have a QLTY tone because of the over and under tones created when the string is vibrating at that length when you play a note on an instrument you aren t hearing just that note you hear that note plus others that are related to it pure tones sound super QLTY to our ears think of a computer making a tone as far as which strings to use it sounds like you re sensitive to timbre and pitch like i am on one of my INSTR i am happy with the fremont blackline strings on another i prefer a mix of strings because i haven t found a set that i like for all four strings the a will sound too pointy and sharp or the c will be bleh or some other thing i don t like so i guess my suggestion would be to experiment with mixing sets and think about and pay attention to how different string types affect the timbre of the pitch bearing in mind what i mentioned above about the length of the vibrating string the part between the fret you re holding and the bridge also plays a big part you can find more information about these concepts by searching for timbre or tonal quality there are some very interesting physics behind it oh also the INSTR scale and body size and all that play a factor too,"['ukuleles', 'ukulele']","['purer', 'dull']"
 tie the cutoff of the filter the strength of the envelope any number of other parameters to the velocity of the keystroke you can make it so that the harder the note is struck the more the filter opens the QLTY the sound is there s a slight upward pitch bend or whatever other features you want to use to get the real feel synthesis is awesome,[],['brighter']
 your tracks is -3 4 and the ref is -4 9 doesn t that mean your track is louder already closer to zero is louder i can also hear from the clip that your track sounds louder than the reference right now the mix is off to my ears the INSTR and INSTR seem be to be floating in different spaces and the rhythm INSTR are way too QLTY and QLTY i would first try to get the INSTR INSTR and rhythm INSTR to glue together before worrying about loudness i would recommend bringing all the faders down and try to rebalance the tracks starting with the INSTR and then rhythm INSTR INSTR let me know if you have any other questions i would be glad to answer,"['drums', 'guitars', 'guitars', 'drums', 'bass', 'guitar', 'drums', 'guitars', 'bass']","['loud', 'muddy']"

 nice write up your conclusion regarding the amp doesn 2019t surprise me much i find that the headphones generally tend to make a far more substantial difference in sound than the amp and dac do at least to a certain degree i 2019ve never heard the jds stack you have but from what i 2019ve read it seems highly competent and will serve both of those headphones well i am someone who found the clear to have a slightly QLTY or QLTY sound to it in the treble region i 2019m not sure why but that 2019s just how i remember them sounding to my ear i 2019d love to try them again some day to see if i still feel that way i had similar concluding thoughts as you did when i owned a pair of clears and hd 660s clears were definitely better but the 660s were crazy good and very competitive for a bit less than half the price however this combined with essentially everything you said regarding repairability drove me to sell the clears and find something a bit different to compliment the 660s i agree completely with your overall conclusion - the hd 600 series headphones are incredibly solid and hold their ground even against much more expensive headphones,[],"['metallic', 'dry']"
 i love my ath-m50x s personally it s a huge leap to those from shitty razer headsets though i mostly use my pc to listen to music and make music though so it s a must to have high quality audio one thing i would note is the ath-m50x s aren t necessarily more bass heavy but have a v shape bias as in the highs and lows will be exaggerated i use them to mix music and i always have to use multiple pairs of headphones and speakers to make sure it sounds good i am guessing for the audience this is meant for though QLTY is not by any means QLTY or overpowered on them and much lighter than headphones advertised as bass boost headphones the ath-mxxx line is made for studio use not necessarily gaming so they naturally will be made to be flatter than normal headphones for gaming or listening i will say they are 100x better though i have went through a pair of m20x m40x and m50x and the 50x is my choice personally i will say the m20x i would recommend buying new earfoam for it after being on your head all day it will start to hurt one last thing to note don t buy a dac if you don t need it you might need it for a 500 pair of open-back sennheisers but i guarantee you won t need one for most headphones under 300 check first but my ath-m50x s are powered fine by my motherboards sound card an amp doesn t improve the quality it just draws power if the soundcard can t draw enough,[],"['heavy bass', 'muddy']"

 question the tone and timbre of gut INSTR strings,['guitar'],[]
 what ive found over the years is that my biggest hitting drops are the ones with the least stuff going on we all know about the idea of playing with tension release but it s really a matter of contrast for the release to feel good you need to have contrast from the post where there is tension so it really depends on what genre arrangement elements structure you are doing in my case i mostly do techno house and i used to think that to get a great drop you need to have stuff that makes it hit harder but after years ive realised that is usually the lack of stuff that makes it so as an example say you ve got a synth line with a filter that opens with a plucky envelope and to build tension during the break you start making the envelope longer and make it so it opens the cutoff more what i used to do was once it got to the drop id leave the filter open and screaming at high frequencies but now i automate it so once it gets to the drop it goes back to a plucky env and really lower the max cutoff compared to the break that always works try it out i think the opposite could work too so if you have a break where you start taking elements off to create tension you can make a drop where suddenly everything comes back together i can leave with a personal example where i created this song just playing around with a INSTR and i got a loop i really liked with a bassline and some syncopated chords and just playing around with different combinations of the parts i ended up leaving a drop where the only things remaining would be the kick sub and the chords taking out all other percussions melodies and even the bassline and that ended up being my favorite part of the track you can hear it here the drop im talking about starts at min 2 20,['piano'],[]
 yeah i mean when you put it like that it is 201call there is too it 201d but if you have ever had to do that it is a gruelling process you think about trying to keep the tonality when your sound design doesnt keep to a key you will find that it is a case of meticulous orchestration and composition tbh that is very much a mr bill way of doing things and i love mr bill but when ive done this myself ive found it to be a overly random composition i like to have more of a musical concept behind the base of my tracks it means that if my sound design isnt as good as i want it to be i still have the basis of a good piece of music theres a quote from someone that says 201cif you can play your song on INSTR and it still sounds good its a good song 201d and i try and remind myself of that when im making stuff,['piano'],[]

 i think the best approach is to focus on great players the albums they ve recorded will introduce you to important composers for the INSTR seeking out recordings based on the composers alone will get you mixed results the trinity of historically important players from last century are andre segovia julian bream john williams these guys have each released great recordings and you ve been recommended them many times over they are not however necessarily the best representatives of the genre here s a more recent selection of great players all well worth a listen manuel barrueco sean shibe kyuhee park david russel sharon isbin it would be a mistake to get into the old masters and never give new artists a listen in many respects they are technically superior and they certainly play a more varied repertoire,['guitar'],[]

 i saw this video that explains how the INSTR don 2019t sound their best until you edit the velocity curves check that out to see if it makes it even better for you i loved the idea of the modx when it was announced i played one in person and while the ui wasn 2019t bad i didn 2019t love it though that 2019s probably due to needing to spend more time with it the keybed i thought was just ok although i really love the price point so i can 2019t complain overall i think i want to get one at some point seems like a great gigging instrument with the montage sound set and a lighter weight,['pianos'],[]
 sure there are some chord voicings that may use it and it s especially useful if you leave for example the two highest strings open on a INSTR and move a chord shape up and down - those open strings make the chords sound connected also unison bends are a common technique used in rock music,['guitar'],[]
 for string instruments that would help with efficient with certain passages and convenience for different chord voicings INSTR and some other wind instruments do a thing called timbral trills usually in jazz where we repeat the same note with either an alternate fingering or different embouchure to alter the timbre of the note for INSTR i suppose playing the same note on different strings could emulate this effect although i would think that the difference in timbre wouldn t be as drastic,"['saxophones', 'guitar']",[]
 on INSTR and the whole family you can use it to play more efficiently comfortably for example if every note except one is all on the same string in a passage or halfway through the passage the notes get higher it s usually easier to just shift higher up on the string also on the highest string if you shift higher up then you practically have an extra fifth string,['violin'],[]
 king crimson 2019s 201cstarless 201d check out what the INSTR is doing after 4 27,['guitar'],[]
 there 2019s an open-g tuning that a band called eagles of death metal use for their INSTR that uses a unison on the lowest strings the tuning is g-g-d-g-b-d the 2 low g notes ringing out give you a droning almost chorus like effect that is important to the timbre of the music the velvet underground and sonic youth are known for using strange tunings that they sometimes call ostrich tunings where most of if not all the strings are tuned to the same note venus in furs was recorded using a INSTR in d-d-d-d-d-d the INSTR used on sy 2019s kool thing were tuned f -f -f -f -e-b this is important for the timbre to have all these strings ringing out that are reinforcing each other,"['guitars', 'guitar', 'guitars']",[]
 there is a lot of potential the same note appears in at least three places on the INSTR the string fret position distance from pickups and bridge all contribute to variations in tone at those positions moving the note to these different locations will greatly affect the harmonic content of the played sound so one note against the same one will still sound different on a stringed instrument additionaly the actual pitch is likely to change between two fretted notes of the same pitch INSTR will not perfectly intonate basically ever therefore you will hear pitch contrast between two notes also for the fundamental,"['guitar', 'guitars']",[]
 sometimes it 2019s just easier in given situations to hit a note on a different string like if you 2019re doing a pattern that you would have to break if you wanted to go to the next string maybe i don 2019t know not a INSTR player other than basic chords there 2019s just options and in given situations some are easier and some are more difficult,['guitar'],[]
 you can play the same note 5 or 6 places on the INSTR depending on how many frets you have,['guitar'],[]
 this is common in INSTR music you ll get some repeated pattern featuring both stopped and open strings and the pattern just moves up and down the neck so sometimes you have a stopped string below an open string sometimes the same string is higher than the open string and sometimes it s the same note and that relationship keeps changing as the open strings don t change pitch while the stopped ones do,['guitar'],[]
 besides the uses on INSTR that have been mentioned concert harps do this for example if you set the b strings to b c and the f strings to fb e you end up with a pentatonic scale c d e g a,['guitar'],[]
 for most of the notes on a INSTR you re always playing the same note on two or three different strings whether you like it or not something i didn t realize until far too recently is that most what you re hearing in an out-of-tune INSTR is the unison spread for the keys strings getting too wide,"['piano', 'piano']",[]
 trey anastasio uses this for effect in a few songs here s an example INSTR comes in at 0 28,['guitar'],[]
 string instruments with double courses INSTR INSTR use a harmonic unison between some or all of the pairs of strings it s used quite regularly on INSTR where a player will hit a note a half or whole step below the pitch of the next higher open string then hammer or slide the finger up to the unison and play both strings it has a particular sound to it ian anderson uses the technique at the beginning of my god tony rice uses the technique for the intro to stony point,"['mandolin', '12-string guitar', 'guitar']",[]

 eli5 how do we perceive different timbres or qualities of sound i understand that sound is vibrations of the air which are picked up by our eardrums and other parts of the inner ear but how do the sound waves created by say a INSTR differ from the sound waves created by a INSTR,"['guitar', 'piano']",[]
 almost no instrument produces a pure tone the INSTR is about the closest generally an instrument produces a load of notes that make up the harmonic series these are notes whose frequencies are a whole number multiple of times the base or fundamental frequency so when you hear a INSTR playing 440hz concert a you re also hearing a little bit of the a an octave higher at 880hz and the e above that at 1320hz and the a at 1760hz etc the exact mix of these notes is what determines tone or timbre you can see this for yourself download a free spectrum analyser app and sing in to it if you whistle you ll see a sharp peak pretty close to a pure tone now sing a few different vowels and you ll see a bunch of spikes as you keep the note the same but change the vowels you ll see the lowest not stays in the same place but the higher tones change in position and amount,"['flute', 'piano']",[]
 this is actually more of a physics question when you play a note on a INSTR you are taking that string causing it to vibrate at a certain frequency thus creating the basic sound wave you mention a INSTR does the same exact thing just using a hammer to strike the string but sound doesn 2019t stop there sound from the INSTR string bounces around the inside of the INSTR causing the waves to interact with each other creating sound waves that look quite different from the typical sine wave you usually see when discussing sound the same thing for the INSTR which is why you can hear a difference between a basic upright INSTR and a INSTR different structures cause the sound to resonate differently causing the same note to sound different depending on the instrument,"['guitar', 'piano', 'guitar', 'guitar', 'piano', 'piano', 'grand piano']",[]

 singing is more physically involved than most other instruments though i hear bagpipping can take quite a bit of stamina too but it is still and instrument too so you not only have to learn how to use your instrument just like INSTR but you also have to understand that your instrument changes unlike INSTR and some muscles can get weaker and stronger and this will affect the end result,"['guitar', 'guitar']",[]

 i aim to be averagely skilled enough to play simple accompaniment to my own singing maybe within a year so that i may go to open mics any other performances to gain experience this is mostly about learning chords to the point of muscle memory you want to get the INSTR playing down to the point where you don t have to spend active brain energy on that - so you can focus on singing and guiding your way through the song you ll also need to develop some good strumming techniques the ability to keep a steady beat the ability to accent certain beats or insert a pause on other beats again lots of practice to get your strumming hand familiar with moving the pick through the strings i d also highly recommend you use a metronome even from day 1 a metronome will help you develop an internal sense of rhythm i wish to write my own songs this will involve knowing some music theory for 99 of pop oriented music you ll want to focus on the major scale learn the notes of the scale next add on top of that how to harmonize the major scale this means you take those notes and build each of them into chords this will give you a set of chords that will all fit in that key so say you want to write a song pick a key let s use c the notes in the c major scale are c d e f g a b you can turn each of those notes into a chord c major d minor e minor f major g major a minor b dim then let s pick 4 of those chords f - c - am - g boom you have a chord progression you could use,['guitar'],[]
 why don t i self learn because i ve heard that it is very easy to form bad habits especially fingering wise so i ve been advised by my singing teacher better to start the absolute basics with a qualified INSTR instructor first i wanted to add a separate reply to this forming good habits with the guidance of a teacher is a good thing but i also want to say that many great INSTR players didn t always use proper technique srv hendrix and clapton didn t use their pinky that much albert king played his INSTR upside down james hetfield holds his pick weird johnny ramone set his INSTR strap way too low marty friedman has a really weird angle on his picking wrist jimmy page could be downright sloppy at times i am not advocating that you intentionally learn poor technique but i just want to say that i also wouldn t get so totally hung up on it that you don t learn any technique a teacher can be a helpful guide but you still want to self-learn and you ll need to think of a teacher more as someone who helps guide and direct your ship but you still have to power the ship and move it forward you ll still need to spend a lot of time effort and energy developing these skills,"['guitar', 'guitar', 'guitar', 'guitar']",[]
 someone else can probably speak to this but you may consider looking at bass amps INSTR specific speakers and open back cabs can get quite flubby on the bottom end and if you re doing an octave or two down a INSTR amp may not be able to handle that frequency another expensive option is to get a dedicated acoustic amp a small bass amp and an a b y splitter so you can more accurately choose which frequencies are filtered to which amp,"['guitar', 'guitar']",[]
 eli5 what is the difference between sound waves of the same pitch but with a different timbre sound quality e g INSTR vs INSTR,"['piano', 'guitar']",[]
 harmonics you can have a synthesizer play you a pure sine wave it has a specific sound most instruments and sounds in real life have harmonics multiples of the base frequency overlapped on top of it think of it as a deep wave out at sea that also has wind ripples on top of it INSTR hits strings with a hammer and the sound resonates in a big block of bronze metal and INSTR strings are plucked with a pick and the sound resonates in a hollow cavity surrounded by wood so even if the strings formed a pure sine tone all the resonating and different materials add QLTY harmonic waves that are multiples of the base tone that fade in different ways for a INSTR especially the sound changes over time as it fades,"['piano', 'guitar', 'piano']",['distortions']
 the amount to which different pitches are present is different for instance i think INSTR only have two frequencies that are majorly present when you play a note a INSTR may have four that is you 2019re not just playing purely a4 with an a4 configuration you may have a5 or a6 or a3 to different amounts according to different instruments the mixture of the different frequencies combined with other factors such as the medium to which the sound travels wood or string or air or brass and amplitude of each frequency results in what we perceive as different timbre there 2019s an amazing lecture by walter lewin on musical instruments that demonstrates this,"['clarinets', 'saxophone']",[]

 what ive found over the years is that my biggest hitting drops are the ones with the least stuff going on we all know about the idea of playing with tension release but it s really a matter of contrast for the release to feel good you need to have contrast from the post where there is tension so it really depends on what genre arrangement elements structure you are doing in my case i mostly do techno house and i used to think that to get a great drop you need to have stuff that makes it hit harder but after years ive realised that is usually the lack of stuff that makes it so as an example say you ve got a synth line with a filter that opens with a plucky envelope and to build tension during the break you start making the envelope longer and make it so it opens the cutoff more what i used to do was once it got to the drop id leave the filter open and screaming at high frequencies but now i automate it so once it gets to the drop it goes back to a plucky env and really lower the max cutoff compared to the break that always works try it out i think the opposite could work too so if you have a break where you start taking elements off to create tension you can make a drop where suddenly everything comes back together i can leave with a personal example where i created this song just playing around with a INSTR and i got a loop i really liked with a bassline and some syncopated chords and just playing around with different combinations of the parts i ended up leaving a drop where the only things remaining would be the kick sub and the chords taking out all other percussions melodies and even the bassline and that ended up being my favorite part of the track you can hear it here the drop im talking about starts at min 2 20,['piano'],[]
 hmm it s a bit more complicated then that most of the time those elements are processed in a certain way to allow them to glue together during the mix down process albeit pretty much most electronic music layers sines underneath to pack more weight behind it unless it s house then that s really just the kick carrying the weight of the track for instance if i design a reece bassline i will tend to split that sound and eq them as 2 different instruments they will then be processed a certain way one for sub and for mid i could then process it get it more warmth and dynamics the quality of your INSTR samples matter a lot as well but from my own personal experience you can polish a turd and make even the most basic idea sound wicked honestly i kinda feel it s the advanced production that make the track hit as hard as it does giving everything it s own space and allowing the more weighty elements to cut through i produce dnb so really you have to nail those main elements or else you got shite even the most simplest dnb tune can drop hard because it s engineered well,['drum'],[]
 i was also a INSTR player who transitioned into making edm and like you i would always start out writing songs the same way as you with chord progressions and melodies i understand your struggle and what i ve done that really helps when writing drops is to write a simple INSTR melody and then create bass sounds that follow the same notes and rhythm as your INSTR melody the key here is to keep the melody simpler than you would if it was being played by a melodic instrument the sound design will fill in the gaps and make your simple not that interesting melody sound great in context of the song also utilize a click track which contains the rhythm you want the drop to follow after laying everything out mute your INSTR melody and click track and boom you have a drop at this point you can adjust your track to fit around your INSTR or vice versa,"['guitar', 'piano', 'piano', 'piano', 'drums']",[]
 a rather underrated composer worldwide manuel m ponce he made many compositions for INSTR maybe one of this video interests you,['guitar'],[]
 yeah i mean when you put it like that it is 201call there is too it 201d but if you have ever had to do that it is a gruelling process you think about trying to keep the tonality when your sound design doesnt keep to a key you will find that it is a case of meticulous orchestration and composition tbh that is very much a mr bill way of doing things and i love mr bill but when ive done this myself ive found it to be a overly random composition i like to have more of a musical concept behind the base of my tracks it means that if my sound design isnt as good as i want it to be i still have the basis of a good piece of music theres a quote from someone that says 201cif you can play your song on INSTR and it still sounds good its a good song 201d and i try and remind myself of that when im making stuff,['piano'],[]
 it depends what genre of music you 2019re talking about i 2019m gonna go ahead with dnb although this is a really diverse genre the key elements are the drums bass sub and melody mid bass or the thing that you recognise about a song other elements are key but they only help to fill up space i 2019ve actually got a song upcoming where i fully improvise INSTR for the intro the drop for that song was a melodic idea repeated and layered onto with terraced dynamics being developed as time goes on it was a rlly simple 4 bar melody loop involving moving down the f minor scale before jumping up a fifth a rlly strong interval and then going back down again to f it 2019s simple yet effective and i really liked it when i first made it it was catchy and i think that 2019s the key thing of what makes an effective drop - it has to be simple yet effective if you can 2019t hum the tune after and immediatley forget it then it wasn 2019t a good tune neurofunk riddim dubstep work the same - they have simple ideas which can be remembered easily too simple and it 2019s just every other riddim crochet rhythm too complex and you 2019ll be unable to sing it after,['piano'],[]
 it depends on the drop you want if you want a bass drop then do what s said in your title if you want an edm drop then you take whatever lead you had before and give it a more powerful sound add some chords a bassline and make your INSTR more complex make sure you fill most of the frequencies use a visual eq to monitor the frequencies on your master track if you want a dubstep drop then all you have to do is incorporate sound change over time manipulate wavetable positions using the lfo change the volume etc x200b drops are actually really easy to do if you understand how to make them i make most of my drops including dubstep drops using 4 tracks or less,['drums'],[]
 eli5 what makes the timbre of a INSTR and INSTR so different they re both string instruments so shouldn t they sound somewhat similar,"['guitar', 'piano']",[]
 they do have some things in common - they re both vibrating strings that are amplified by a wooden chamber for the sound to reverberate in the case of an INSTR and INSTR the primary difference is what causes the string to make its sound a INSTR uses a nylon or steel string that s plucked using a fingertip or plastic pick a typical INSTR key is actually three different steel wires that are all struck simultaneously by a hammer covered in felt there are lots of other differences like the tension of the string the methods used to stop the vibration the range of possible notes that can be played the number of simultaneous notes and so on a surprising range of sounds can be made by instruments that are surprisingly similar a INSTR is a string instrument and similar in many ways to a INSTR but it has a very different sound in large part because it s played with a bow but there are many other subtle differences that overall lead to a quite different sound,"['acoustic guitar', 'grand piano', 'guitar', 'piano', 'violin', 'guitar']",[]

 1 practice INSTR you don t need to be able to play anything complicated but you need to be able to move through open chords easily 2 listen learn where the indie folk artists of today came from woody guthrie the weavers pete seeger phil ochs kingston trio dave van ronk etc,['guitar'],[]
 i 2019m about to get in bed so i 2019ll be brief here i 2019m 30 something and can 100 relate to what you feel about racing to catch up now that i 2019m past the point of being able to catch up i realized i shouldn 2019t have been trying to catch up to people who are on their own path i 2019ve just seriously started getting into making music same style i love it in the past two years after playing mediocre INSTR for about 10 years i 2019m enjoying it more than ever and feel very proud of what i 2019m creating it feels very true to myself something that sticks out to me in the folk genre is its honesty both in the content and delivery just be you without editing out the parts you don 2019t think sound nice and i think you 2019ll find that folk honesty try to write a few reactive songs where you aren 2019t trying to deliver a message or tell a story but you 2019re just writing a little song as a reaction to something that stuck out to you i 2019ve written them reacting to a headline scrolling in a gas station tv seeing a crochet daisy on a christmas tree my cat trying to wake me up etc i 2019ve found that these songs that happen as a reaction to something tend to be the most honest if i try to write a song i 2019m literally just trying to make something up if i use my already existing reactions to things to write songs i can just be who i am and make music out of that hope that helps the shortest answer here is just to make songs song after song songs that you want to sing or want to hear good luck,['guitar'],[]
 this is pretty good it amazes me how many people buy shitty speakers or headsets to go with their frankly amazing pc builds ive been hunting around for a half decent small amp to power my 2x b w 686 s currently using a sony 7 1 amp but its massive and ive lost the remote and the topping youve linked looks a decent budget option optical sw reasonable power only have a cheap xonar sound card but it all helps to improve the sound quality i do some recording at home just bass INSTR via presonus audiobox and it helps to have some half decent sound thats not logitech speakers would this amp be capable of powering b w 683 s i have a 7 1 set i dont use any more and its a shame to have these idling in my loft i suspect i d need something a bit better for the big ones also grado headphones are another reaonably priced headphone manufacturer that has great sound quality,['guitar'],[]
 hey dude i think it 2019s important not to conflate a few different skill sets here music theory playing INSTR writing a song and singing they all definitely have a role in the process but it 2019s probably smart to distinguish between them so you can focus your efforts i think the INSTR playing component is the least mysterious plenty of notable of songwriters have eked by with minimal skill you will probably deal mostly with chords so i 2019d start there beyond major and minor there are three types of 7 chords major 7 minor 7 dominant 7 that can add a lot of color and identity to a songs base i 2019d focus on learning as many of these shapes as possible happy to provide more info on that writing a song is way less clear it 2019s super challenging and like others have mentioned the secret sauce is really just doing it over and over ad nauseum see the gap for some classic ira glass wisdom they 2019ll probably be bad at first but that 2019s okay you just have to start write a song and finish it finishing is the important bit and then do it again if i can recommend some literature that might be helpful i 2019d highly recommend the war of art by steven pressfield spoiler alert the main thesis of the book is just to fight through resistance and keep creating even when you think it sucks or get discouraged great read also if you 2019re into uncle tupelo or wilco which by the sound of it you well may be then i 2019d also highly recommend jeff tweedy 2019s memoir let 2019s go so we can get back he has a great philosophy on songwriting and talks about it a lot he also published a book called how to write one song which i haven 2019t read but imagine is great as well sorry for the ramble - good luck music is equally frustrating and satisfying but a lifelong journey and definitely worth pursuing,"['guitar', 'guitar']",[]

 the ave maria is totally possible to play on a INSTR more or less the same as the video but here s a super cool non-classical example from a more impressive player than the one in the video edit neither of the performers are me i just found the videos to play that on INSTR you d almost certainly have to compromise the parts where he s playing at both ends of the range and if you could manage to play the rest i imagine there d be a lot more contortionism involved,"['classical guitar', 'guitar']",[]

 i saw this video that explains how the INSTR don 2019t sound their best until you edit the velocity curves check that out to see if it makes it even better for you i loved the idea of the modx when it was announced i played one in person and while the ui wasn 2019t bad i didn 2019t love it though that 2019s probably due to needing to spend more time with it the keybed i thought was just ok although i really love the price point so i can 2019t complain overall i think i want to get one at some point seems like a great gigging instrument with the montage sound set and a lighter weight,['pianos'],[]
